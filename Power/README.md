This is the R code used to estimate the power for when computing the statistical analysis of hierarchical single-cell RNA-seq data. We carried out the following steps:

  1) Simulate a new dataset with the desired structure (foldchange, number of genes, number of cells per individual, number of individuals, etc.)
  2) Filter and normalize the data.
  2) Compute the statistical tests using MAST with a random effect for individual.
  3) Store the pvalues and compute the power(s) at the desired alpha(s).
